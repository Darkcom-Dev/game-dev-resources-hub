                <summary><h2>Environment Setup</h2></summary> 
                <h3>Required Software Installation</h3>
            <p>
                The product does not require additional installations as long as the minimum software requirements
                specified in the documentation are met. Ensure compatible versions are used to avoid compatibility
                issues.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Engine Configuration</h3>
            <p>
                While the engine can render models without special configurations, mobile game developers should
                consider the following recommendations to optimize performance.
            </p>
        
            <h4>Resolution Limitations</h4>
            <p>
                This product is optimized for resolutions of <strong>1080p or lower.</strong> It is not recommended for use on 
                <strong>4K or 8K displays</strong> due to the performance impact unless the game camera is distant, such as in real-time
                strategy (RTS) games.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Graphic Optimizations</h3>
            <p>
                The following optional graphical optimizations are suggested to maximize efficiency without
                sacrificing visual quality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Custom Shaders:</strong> Design shaders to combine grayscale textures such as Roughness, Ambient
                    Occlusion (AO), or Translucency. This reduces the number of individual textures and optimizes
                    memory usage.</li>
                <li><strong>Texture Compression:</strong> For performance-critical projects, consider merging AO with Albedo via
                    color multiplication or storing Roughness in the Alpha channel. This may require baking
                    textures or making irreversible adjustments.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Processing:</strong> Use effects like SSAO (Screen Space Ambient Occlusion) to enhance lighting
                    without relying on AO textures. Adding a Bloom effect can also improve realism.</li>
                <li><strong>Shader Optimization:</strong> If skilled in shader programming, combine multiple effects into a single
                    pass to reduce graphical load.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Compression Formats</h3>
            <p>
                For textures, the recommended compression format is <strong>ASTC</strong>, as it provides high quality and
                compatibility with modern devices. If the target device encounters issues or glitches, switch to <strong>ETC2</strong>
                as an alternative.

                </summary>
                <h3>Model Installation Guide</h3>
                <p>
                    Most game engines are compatible with files exported from Blender. However, some engines interpret
axis orientation differently. By default, all models are configured with the <strong>Z-axis pointing up</strong>, but in
certain engines, such as Unity, the <strong>Y-axis points up.</strong> To address this discrepancy, you can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rotate the models <strong>90° on the Y-axis</strong> in Blender before exporting.</li>
                    <li>Use formats such as <strong>.glb or .fbx</strong>, which generally adjust this mismatch automatically.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Material Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    Although engines are compatible with Blender, the fidelity of materials is often affected during import.
Most engines assign a default <strong>PBR (Physically Based Rendering)</strong> material and approximately map
the textures. To optimize materials:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The texture <em>r-rough-b-ao.png</em> combines roughness information in the red channel <em>(Roughness)</em>
                        and ambient occlusion in the blue channel <em>(Ambient Occlusion)</em>.</li>
                    <li>You may need to configure a <em>custom shader</em> to correctly interpret these data.</li>
                    <li>The additional files package includes a <em>GLSL shader</em> compatible with Blender, which can
                        serve as a base for designing a custom shader in your preferred engine.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <h3>Texture Atlas Setup</h3>
                <p>
                    Some engines, such as Unreal Engine, allow combining multiple textures into a <em>large Texture Atlas</em> of
                    up to <em>8192x8192 pixels.</em> If your engine supports this feature, you can use it to manage textures more
                    efficiently. However:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most engines do not support this feature automatically, which may require manual adjustments.</li>
                    <li>The models are already designed with an optimized Texture Atlas, so additional configuration is
                        generally unnecessary.</li>
                </ul>

                </summary>
                    <h3>Model Hierarchy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each product is delivered as a single file in a specific format <em>(.blend, .fbx, .obj, .glb, etc.)</em>, containing
                        multiple optimized meshes. These meshes share a single texture to ensure efficiency and compatibility.
                        Key features include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Uniform Scale:</em> All meshes have a scale of <em>1.0</em> on each axis.</li>
                        <li><em>Standard Rotation:</em> Rotations are set to <em>0.0</em> to prevent inconsistencies during import.</li>
                        <li><em>Metric Units:</em> Models are configured in meters to align with the International System of Units (SI).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        If the model is designed to include animations, movable parts are separated from static parts to simplify
                        manipulation. Most products do not include preconfigured bones or animations unless explicitly
                        specified. For further details, consult the model-specific manual.
                    </p>
                
                    <h3>Texture Atlas Usage</h3>
                    <p>
                        Meshes utilize an <em>optimized Texture Atlas</em> to maximize texture area usage and minimize graphical
load. The UV maps are configured with the following features:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Efficient Distribution:</em> UV islands are proportioned to match the model size, ensuring uniform
                            resolution across all meshes.</li>
                        <li><em>Minimal Stretching:</em> UV cuts are designed to capture maximum detail without noticeable
                            distortions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        his approach, however, has a limitation: separating meshes to apply individual textures can be
                        challenging. In such cases, you may need to <em>bake textures into a new UV map.</em>

                </summary>
                <h3>Tips to Reduce Performance Impact</h3>
                <p>
                    To optimize performance on mobile devices, compress textures using the <strong>ASTC</strong> format whenever the
                    target device supports it. If incompatible, use <strong>ETC2</strong> as an alternative. All products are designed with a
                    <strong>maximum of 5,000 vertices per model</strong> to ensure efficient graphical load. While reducing polygon
                    count further is possible, doing so may compromise the mesh's visual quality.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Level of Detail (LOD) Configuration</h3>
                <p>
                    Most models are not pre-configured with Levels of Detail <em>(LOD)</em>. If you decide to implement them,
                    performance improvements may be marginal depending on the project. A more efficient alternative is
                    using a <em>tessellation-based shader</em> to smooth edges dynamically, optimizing both visual quality and
                    performance.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Lighting and Shadows</h3>
                <p>
                    For projects with dynamic lighting, such as day-night cycles, implement shaders that calculate lighting
                    at the <strong>vertex level</strong> and manage shadows with minimal or no bias. This reduces GPU computational load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For static lighting projects, take advantage of <strong>baked shadows and normals</strong> on static objects. This
                    significantly improves performance by eliminating real-time lighting calculations.

                <h2>Model Handling and Usage</h2>
                </summary>
                <h3>Object Positioning</h3>
                <p>
                    Meshes are designed with the pivot located at the <em>base of the model</em> to facilitate placement on flat
                    surfaces. For irregular objects that may be thrown or physically manipulated, the pivot is positioned at
                    their <em>center of mass</em> to ensure more intuitive handling within the game engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, meshes are configured with <em>standardized dimensions</em> proportional to real-world objects,
                    reducing the need for scaling adjustments in most cases. This modularity simplifies integration into
                    various scenarios.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Animation Application</h3>
                <p>
                    By default, most models do not include predefined animations. If animations are available, detailed
                    instructions are provided in the <em>product-specific manual</em> included with the package.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Interaction with Engine Scripts and Physics</h3>
                <p>
                    Most models are designed as <strong>static objects</strong> with no complex hierarchies, simplifying interaction with
                    physics systems and game scripts. However, some models may feature additional functionalities, such
                    as data stored in <strong>vertex colors</strong>. In such cases, additional files will be included to support these features:
                </p>

                <h3>Misaligned Uvs</h3>
                <p>
                    If UVs are not properly assigned, open Blender and check the number of UV maps in the mesh section.
                    It is possible that more than one UV map was mistakenly included. Simply delete the one that doesn't
                    work. Note that stores typically review the content to ensure functionality before publication.
                </p>
                <h3>Textures Not Displaying Correctly</h3>
                <p>
                   Default textures are located in the same directory as the main file. If the file was accidentally moved to
                   a different location, reassign the textures to their new location within the material settings.
                </p>
                <h3>Compression Quality Loss</h3>
                <p>
                    The product textures are provided in uncompressed <em>PNG format</em> so users can apply compression based
                    on their needs. If compression issues occur, use a format that supports lossless compression and ensure
                    reasonable compression values to maintain quality.

                    <h3>Why do the models use a texture atlas instead of individual textures?</h3>
                    <p>The texture atlas significantly reduces draw calls and optimizes GPU memory usage. This improves
                        performance on mobile and VR devices, allowing for high FPS without sacrificing visual quality.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div>
                    <h3>What should I do if the model appears rotated when importing it?</h3>
                    <p>This is a common issue due to different axis configurations in engines. You can fix it by rotating the
                        model 90 degrees on the Y-axis or using .glb/.fbx formats, which typically handle this situation better.</p>
                </div>
            
                <div>
                    <h3>How do I handle textures that combine multiple data in their RGB channels?</h3>
                    <p>Use a custom shader to separate the channels. For example, for a texture like r-rough-b-ao.png, extract
                        roughness from the red channel and ambient occlusion from the blue channel. Example GLSL shaders
                        can be found in the additional files.</p>

                <div >
                    <h3>Can I modify the UVs to use individual textures?</h3>
                    <p>It is possible but not recommended. It would require redoing the UV mapping and baking new textures,
                        which could result in quality loss and eliminate the optimization benefits of the texture atlas.</p>

                    <p>This limit ensures compatibility with most mobile devices and engines while maintaining a good
                        balance between visual quality and performance. Larger textures could cause issues on modest
                        hardware.</p>

                    <h3>Can I use these models in high-resolution games (4K/8K)?</h3>
                    <p>They are not recommended for close-up views in 4K/8K. However, they work well in 1080p or for
                        distant views, such as in RTS games, even at higher resolutions.</p>

                    <h3>Is it possible to further reduce the polygon count of the models?</h3>
                    <p>The models are already optimized with a limit of 5000 vertices. Further reduction would likely visibly
                        degrade the quality of the mesh.</p>
